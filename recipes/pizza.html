    <p>Pizza dough made from scratch is topped with mozzarella cheese, sauce, and your choice of savory toppings, then grilled to perfection for a fun outdoor treat.  </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed  </li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast  </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar  </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt  </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
        <li>7 ounces ground beef </li>
        <li>6 ounces ground pork </li>
        <li>½ cup Pizza sauce  </li>
        <li>1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce </li>
        <li>1 ounce Shredded mozzarella cheese  </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li><h3> Step 1 </h3> Start charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li><h3> Step 2 </h3> Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        
        <li><h3> Step 3 </h3> Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
        <li><h3> Step 4 </h3> Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach and cover until it returns to a boil. Stir gently and cook until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</li>
        <li><h3> Step 5 </h3> Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as much water and possible; reserve the liquid. Puree spinach in a blender until smooth.</li>
        <li><h3> Step 6 </h3> Sift flour into a bowl. Make a well in the center; add eggs, spinach, and about 1 tablespoon of the reserved liquid. Mix together by hand or using the dough hook of a stand mixer, adding more liquid if needed. Knead until dough becomes a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
